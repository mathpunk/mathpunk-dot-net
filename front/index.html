<p>i write, i do math, i do theater, and i talk. (and talk and talk.) i'm learning about data science-and-art.</p>

<p>you can hire me for things like tutoring, speaking, consulting, researching, programming, decomplecting, and datamancy.</p>

<p>you can see me embarrass myself publically on twitter and github. but this site is mine.</p>

<p>if you want to contact me, twitter is a good place to start a conversation. i do read email, but i can be very slow to 
reply. you might want to schedule a time to chat.</p>
