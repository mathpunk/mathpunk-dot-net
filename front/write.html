  In 2010 I Kickstarted a book called <i>Punk Mathematics</i>. It's an attempt at
  explaining my mathematical philosophy: the importance of mistakes, of radical inclusion,
  and of using mathematical concepts to look at the world around us and expand our minds.  

	To my surprise, even if you've been thinking about something for ten years, it can take
  a long time to explain it. I have an enormous amount of material, and I am currently
  editing and revising it down to the essentials. 

  If you'd like to see the video in which I explain the initial concept, or you want to
  read angry comments from people who believe I'm a scammer, visit the Punk Mathematics
  Kickstarter page. You can also order a pretty wicked shirt from punkmathematics.com
   
  Status: ongoing.
