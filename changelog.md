Stole a very rough outline of "how to do a dynamic site" from swannodette.github.io,
despite the site itself not being enlive. This... may not be my best idea.

Next, created a branch for a static site, so I can just get the thing up. It has an index that should mostly satisfy indieauth,
a statement of support for indie-and-open web principles, and that's about it.

NEXT: use clojure-cookbook's guide to making sites with Enlive. I gotta say, I'm still a little unclear on when to use CLJS and when
to use CLJ.
