    i believe we should own our digital identities and the data that we create for the
    web. some projects, organizations, and other entities promoting indie and open web principles include:
    <ul> 
      <li><a href="http://indiewebcamp.com">IndieWebCamp</a>
      <!-- <li><a href="">blah blah</a>Amber Case's talk at Realtimeconf, from an
      alternate reality -->
      <li><a href="http://ds106.us">ds106</a>, the digital storytelling course
      <li><a href="http://mozilla.org">Mozilla</a>  <!-- specifics? -->
      <li><a href="http://cashmusic.org">CASH Music</a>, a nonprofit empowering musicians.
      <li>And of course, the National Security Administration, for making it all seem just
      a bit more urgent.
    </ul>
