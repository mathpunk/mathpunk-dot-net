    i believe we should own our digital identities and the data that we create for the
    web. some projects, organizations, and other entities promoting indie and open web principles include:
    <ul> 
      <li><a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/principles">IndieWebCamp</a>, the group that
      got me thinking about this;
      <li><a href="http://vimeo.com/77352414">"The open web and the opportunity of
        now"</a>, a talk from an alternate reality by Amber Case, which finally got me
      doing it;
      <li><a href="http://ds106.us">ds106</a>, a punk-as-fuck digital storytelling course,
      taught at University of Mary Washington but open to all;
      <li><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/">Mozilla</a>;
      <li><a href="http://cashmusic.org">CASH Music</a>, a nonprofit empowering musicians
      toward a sustainable future;
      <li><a href="http://opennews.org/">knight-mozilla Open News</a>, a network of
      journalists, hackers, and hacker-journalists;
      <li>And of course, the National Security Administration, for making it all seem just
      a little bit more urgent than it used to.
    </ul>
