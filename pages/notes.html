	The state-of-the-art in annotating, glossing, transcluding, collaborating on, remixing, drawing on, and composing text is all unacceptable. The current approaches are closed-source, overly linear, insufficiently visual, subject to data lock-in, and/or encourage premature labeling of unformed ideas. This page is for experiments in changing all that.

<h2>Ideas, case studies, avenues</h2>
<ul>
	<li>I've used Evernote for years because it was the least bad option available, and now I have major data lock-in. Liberating my data is a work-in-progress.</li>
	<li>Twitter is a nice place to ideate and receive feedback, but the archiving is not great. In alignment with #indieweb principles, I intend to POSSE or PESOS my twitter feed. I also need to quit using favorites as a way of saving tweets I'd like to archive.</li>
	<li>Amber Case has a <a href="http://caseorganic.com/wiki/Main_Page">public wiki</a>. Anyone she follows on twitter can log in to edit it.</li>
	<li>AnnotateJS intrigues me but I haven't used it.</li>
