<div id="computation">
  My mathematical interests include game theory, quantum game theory, partial orders, graph
  theory, combinatorics, algebra, and category theory. 
  
  I am especially interested in understanding text: composing it, collaborating with it,
  publishing it, funding its creation, and sharing it and anti-sharing it (i.e.,
  encryption).

  My current research is centered on mathematical techniques in data mining, data
  visualization, and design. Right now I am trying to understand the category theory of
  databases (see "Simplicial Databases" by Spivak), and learn the fundamentals of
  algebraic topology and algebraic geometry (see The Shape of Data blog).
